# Calbikes
As students of UC Berkeley and also bikers, we found it inconvenient every time
we need to find some place to fix our bikes or to buy replacement parts, especially
when most stores are off the grid on Google Maps. We decided to build our own app to
share with all the bikers in the area just in case they need it. Please share if you like
our app!
